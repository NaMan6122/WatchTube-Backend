Controllers
Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.
They contain the logic for different actions that can be performed on the data and are typically organized
by resource (e.g., users, products).
Controllers are responsible for handling the logic associated with
different actions (like getting data, saving data, etc.).

// User controller
const userController = {
    getAllUsers: (req, res) => {
        // Logic to get all users
        res.send("Get all users");
    },
    createUser: (req, res) => {
        // Logic to create a user
        res.send("User created");
    }
};

export default userController;
