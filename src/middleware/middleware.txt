Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request (req), response (res),
and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
They can perform a variety of tasks such as logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, etc.

Middleware functions are used to process requests before they reach the route handlers. 
They can modify the req and res objects, perform tasks like logging, authentication, or parsing request bodies, 
and then pass control to the next middleware function or route handler.

import express from 'express';
const app = express();

// Logger middleware
function logger(req, res, next) {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route handler
}

// Use middleware globally
app.use(logger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
